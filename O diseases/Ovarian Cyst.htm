 <h1>Ovarian Cyst</h1>

        <h2>Understanding Ovarian Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on the surface or inside an ovary. Ovaries are two small organs located on each side of the uterus in women. They produce eggs and hormones like oestrogen and progesterone. Ovarian cysts are quite common, and most are benign (non-cancerous) and often disappear on their own without treatment. However, some ovarian cysts can cause symptoms, and a small percentage may be cancerous or require medical intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are several types of ovarian cysts, the most common being functional cysts, which are related to the menstrual cycle.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Follicular Cyst:** During a normal menstrual cycle, an egg grows in a sac called a follicle. This follicle usually breaks open to release the egg. If the follicle doesn't break open or if it fills with fluid, it can form a follicular cyst.</li>
            <li>**Corpus Luteum Cyst:** After an egg is released, the follicle shrinks into a structure called the corpus luteum, which produces hormones to prepare for a possible pregnancy. If the corpus luteum fills with fluid, it can form a corpus luteum cyst.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Other types of ovarian cysts that are not related to the menstrual cycle include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Dermoid Cyst (Teratoma):** These cysts contain tissue such as hair, skin, or teeth because they form from embryonic cells.</li>
            <li>**Cystadenoma:** These cysts develop on the outer surface of the ovary and can be filled with watery or mucous material.</li>
            <li>**Endometrioma (Chocolate Cyst):** These occur in women with endometriosis, where uterine-like tissue grows outside the uterus. When this tissue attaches to the ovary, it can form a cyst filled with old blood, giving it a chocolate-like appearance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Symptoms of Ovarian Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            Many ovarian cysts cause no symptoms and are often discovered during a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound done for another reason. However, if a cyst is large, ruptures, twists, or bleeds, it can cause symptoms such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Pelvic Pain:** This can range from a dull ache to a sharp, severe pain. It may be constant or intermittent and may radiate to the back or thighs.</li>
            <li>**Bloating or Fullness in the Abdomen:** A feeling of pressure or fullness in the lower abdomen.</li>
            <li>**Nausea and Vomiting:** Especially if the pain is severe.</li>
            <li>**Pain During Bowel Movements:** Pressure from the cyst can affect the bowel.</li>
            <li>**Frequent Urination:** A large cyst can press on the bladder.</li>
            <li>**Pain During Intercourse (Dyspareunia):**</li>
            <li>**Heavy or Irregular Periods:** Although this is less common with most benign cysts.</li>
            <li>**Weight Gain:** Unexplained weight gain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sudden, severe abdominal or pelvic pain could indicate a ruptured cyst or ovarian torsion (twisting of the ovary), which requires immediate medical attention.
        </p>

        <h2>Risk Factors for Ovarian Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            While most women can develop ovarian cysts, certain factors may increase the likelihood:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Hormonal Imbalances:** Fluctuations in hormone levels, such as those associated with puberty, pregnancy, or hormonal therapy.</li>
            <li>**Endometriosis:** Women with endometriosis are more likely to develop endometriomas.</li>
            <li>**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):** This condition can cause multiple small cysts on the ovaries.</li>
            <li>**Previous Ovarian Cysts:** Women who have had ovarian cysts in the past are at a higher risk of developing them again.</li>
            <li>**Hypothyroidism:** Some studies suggest a possible link.</li>
            <li>**Use of Fertility Drugs:** Medications that stimulate ovulation can increase the risk of developing multiple functional cysts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis of Ovarian Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            Ovarian cysts can be diagnosed through various methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Pelvic Exam:** A doctor may feel an enlarged ovary during a routine pelvic exam.</li>
            <li>**Ultrasound:** This is the primary imaging test used to confirm the presence of a cyst, determine its size, shape, and location, and whether it is fluid-filled, solid, or mixed. Transvaginal ultrasound (where the probe is inserted into the vagina) often provides a better view of the ovaries.</li>
            <li>**Laparoscopy:** A minimally invasive surgical procedure where a small incision is made in the abdomen and a thin, lighted instrument with a camera (laparoscope) is inserted to directly view the ovaries and remove cysts if necessary.</li>
            <li>**Blood Tests:** CA-125 blood test may be ordered to help evaluate if a cyst is cancerous, but this test can also be elevated in non-cancerous conditions. Other blood tests may be done to check hormone levels or rule out other conditions.</li>
            <li>**CT Scan or MRI:** These imaging techniques may be used if more detailed information is needed, especially if a cyst appears complex or if there is concern about cancer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment and Management of Ovarian Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            The approach to managing an ovarian cyst depends on factors such as the woman's age, the size and type of the cyst, symptoms, and whether the cyst appears suspicious for cancer. Management options include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Watchful Waiting:** Many small, asymptomatic functional cysts will resolve on their own within a few menstrual cycles. In these cases, the doctor may recommend periodic pelvic exams and ultrasounds to monitor the cyst.</li>
            <li>**Medications:** Hormonal birth control pills can prevent the development of new functional cysts but will not shrink existing ones. Pain relievers may be recommended to manage pain.</li>
            <li>**Surgery:** Surgery may be necessary if the cyst is large, causing symptoms, appears suspicious for cancer, is growing, ruptures, or causes ovarian torsion. Surgical options include:
                <ul>
                    <li>**Laparoscopy:** A minimally invasive procedure to remove the cyst through small abdominal incisions.</li>
                    <li>**Laparotomy:** A more extensive surgery involving a larger abdominal incision, typically used for larger or potentially cancerous cysts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The type of surgery will depend on the size and appearance of the cyst and whether there is a concern for malignancy. In some cases, the ovary itself may need to be removed (oophorectomy).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is important to monitor ovarian cysts and ensure timely intervention if needed.

        <h2>Important Information</h2>
        <p>
            Most ovarian cysts are harmless and go away on their own. However, it's important to be aware of potential symptoms and to seek medical attention if you experience severe pelvic pain or other concerning signs. Regular pelvic exams can help detect ovarian cysts early.
