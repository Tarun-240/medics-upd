        <h1>Ovarian Cancer</h1>

        <h2>Understanding Ovarian Cancer</h2>
        <p>
            Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries. The ovaries are two small, almond-shaped organs located on each side of the uterus. They produce eggs (ova) as well as the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Ovarian cancer is often not detected until it has spread within the pelvis and abdomen, making it more difficult to treat. Early-stage ovarian cancer, when the disease is confined to the ovary, is more likely to be treated successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ovarian cancer is an umbrella term for different types of cancers that originate in the ovary. The main types include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Epithelial Ovarian Cancer:** This is the most common type, accounting for about 90% of ovarian cancers. It arises from the cells on the surface of the ovary. Subtypes include serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous carcinomas.</li>
            <li>**Germ Cell Tumours:** These cancers develop from the egg-producing cells of the ovary and tend to occur in younger women.</li>
            <li>**Stromal Tumours:** These cancers arise from the structural tissue of the ovary that produces hormones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Symptoms of Ovarian Cancer</h2>
        <p>
            Early-stage ovarian cancer often has no noticeable symptoms. Symptoms may become more apparent as the tumour grows, but they can be vague and mimic other, less serious conditions. These symptoms may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Abdominal or Pelvic Pain:** Persistent or recurring pain in the abdomen or pelvis.</li>
            <li>**Bloating:** Feeling bloated or having increased abdominal size.</li>
            <li>**Feeling Full Quickly:** Feeling full after eating only a small amount.</li>
            <li>**Frequent Urination:** Needing to urinate more often.</li>
            <li>**Changes in Bowel Habits:** Such as constipation or diarrhoea.</li>
            <li>**Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired.</li>
            <li>**Indigestion or Heartburn:** Persistent digestive issues.</li>
            <li>**Pain During Intercourse:** (Dyspareunia)</li>
            <li>**Unexplained Weight Loss or Gain:**</li>
            <li>**Changes in Menstrual Cycle:** Although this is less common with epithelial ovarian cancer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's important to note that these symptoms are not specific to ovarian cancer and can be caused by many other conditions. However, if you experience any of these symptoms frequently or they are new and persistent, it's crucial to discuss them with your doctor.
        </p>

        <h2>Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer</h2>
        <p>
            While the exact causes of most ovarian cancers are not fully understood, several factors can increase a woman's risk:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Age:** The risk of ovarian cancer increases with age, with most cases occurring after menopause.</li>
            <li>**Family History:** Having a mother, sister, or daughter with ovarian cancer increases the risk. Certain genetic mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, are strongly linked to an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. Other gene mutations like MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 (associated with Lynch syndrome), PTEN, and ATM can also increase the risk.</li>
            <li>**Personal History of Certain Cancers:** Women who have had breast, colorectal, or uterine cancer may have a higher risk.</li>
            <li>**Never Having Been Pregnant:** Women who have never been pregnant or carried a pregnancy to term may have a slightly higher risk.</li>
            <li>**Early Menarche (start of menstruation) or Late Menopause:** Longer exposure to oestrogen may increase the risk.</li>
            <li>**Endometriosis:** This condition, where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, may increase the risk of certain types of ovarian cancer (endometrioid and clear cell).</li>
            <li>**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):** Some studies suggest a possible link.</li>
            <li>**Obesity:** Being overweight or obese may be associated with a slightly higher risk.</li>
            <li>**Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):** Long-term use of oestrogen-only HRT may slightly increase the risk.</li>
            <li>**Smoking:** May be associated with an increased risk of mucinous ovarian cancer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Factors that may be associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer include pregnancy, breastfeeding, and the use of oral contraceptives.
        </p>

        <h2>Diagnosis of Ovarian Cancer</h2>
        <p>
            Diagnosing ovarian cancer can be challenging, especially in the early stages. There is currently no reliable screening test for all women at average risk. If ovarian cancer is suspected based on symptoms or risk factors, the following tests may be used:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Pelvic Exam:** A physical examination of the reproductive organs.</li>
            <li>**Transvaginal Ultrasound:** An imaging technique where a probe is inserted into the vagina to visualize the ovaries and uterus.</li>
            <li>**Blood Tests:** Measuring the level of CA-125, a protein that is often elevated in women with ovarian cancer (although it can also be elevated in other conditions). Other tumour markers may also be checked.</li>
            <li>**Imaging Tests:** CT scans, MRI, or PET scans may be used to assess the extent of the cancer and whether it has spread.</li>
            <li>**Laparoscopy or Laparotomy:** Surgical procedures to examine the ovaries and surrounding tissues. Biopsies can be taken during these procedures to confirm the presence of cancer and determine the type and grade.</li>
            <li>**Paracentesis:** If there is fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites), a sample may be drawn and tested for cancer cells.</li>
            <li>**Biopsy:** A tissue sample is necessary to definitively diagnose ovarian cancer. This is usually obtained during surgery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            After diagnosis, staging is performed to determine the extent of the cancer, which is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and predicting prognosis.
        </p>

        <h2>Treatment of Ovarian Cancer</h2>
        <p>
            Treatment for ovarian cancer typically involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Other treatments, such as targeted therapy and hormone therapy, may be used in specific situations. The main treatment modalities include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Surgery:** Often the first step in treating ovarian cancer. The extent of surgery depends on the stage of the cancer but may involve removal of one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy), the uterus (hysterectomy), the omentum (a fatty tissue in the abdomen), and nearby lymph nodes. For early-stage cancer, minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy) may be an option.</li>
            <li>**Chemotherapy:** Uses drugs to kill cancer cells. It is often given after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be administered intravenously (through a vein) or intraperitoneally (directly into the abdomen).</li>
            <li>**Targeted Therapy:** Drugs that target specific abnormalities in cancer cells. Examples include PARP inhibitors (like olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib) for women with BRCA mutations or other genetic changes, and angiogenesis inhibitors (like bevacizumab) that block the growth of new blood vessels that tumours need to grow.</li>
            <li>**Hormone Therapy:** May be used for certain types of stromal tumours.</li>
            <li>**Radiation Therapy:** Less commonly used for primary ovarian cancer but may be used to treat cancer that has spread to other areas or to relieve symptoms.</li>
            <li>**Clinical Trials:** Participation in clinical trials may offer access to new and innovative treatments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Treatment is highly individualized and depends on the stage and grade of the cancer, the type of ovarian cancer, the patient's overall health, and genetic factors. Follow-up care is essential to monitor for recurrence.
