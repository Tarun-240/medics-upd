		<h1>Genital Herpes</h1>

        <h2>About Genital Herpes</h2>
        <p>
            Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can cause pain, sores, and blisters in the genital area.  Genital herpes is a chronic condition, meaning that once someone is infected, the virus remains in the body and can cause recurrent outbreaks.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of herpes simplex virus:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HSV-1: Primarily causes oral herpes (cold sores), but can also cause genital herpes through oral-genital contact.</li>
            <li>HSV-2: Primarily causes genital herpes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms of Genital Herpes</h2>
        <p>
            Many people with genital herpes have no or very mild symptoms.  Symptoms can vary from person to person.  The first outbreak (primary infection) is often the most severe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Symptoms may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pain or itching: In the genital or anal area.</li>
            <li>Small red bumps or tiny white blisters: These blisters rupture, leading to open sores.</li>
            <li>Ulcers: Painful sores in the genital area, buttocks, inner thighs, or anus.</li>
            <li>Scabs: As the ulcers heal.</li>
            <li>Painful urination (dysuria)</li>
            <li>Swollen lymph nodes: In the groin.</li>
            <li>Flu-like symptoms: During the primary outbreak, some people may experience fever, muscle aches, and headache.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Subsequent outbreaks (recurrences) are usually shorter and less severe than the primary outbreak.  Over time, the number of outbreaks tends to decrease.  Symptoms of recurrent outbreaks may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prodromal symptoms:  Some people experience tingling, burning, or itching at the site where the sores will develop, a few days before the outbreak.</li>
            <li>Fewer sores:  Recurrent outbreaks typically involve fewer sores than the primary outbreak.</li>
            <li>Shorter duration:  Outbreaks usually heal faster.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes of Genital Herpes</h2>
        <p>
            Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The virus is highly contagious and is primarily spread through sexual contact.
        </p>
        <p>
            The virus is spread through:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Direct contact with herpes sores:  The virus is most easily spread when sores are present.</li>
            <li>Sexual contact: Vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has genital herpes.</li>
            <li>Skin-to-skin contact:  The virus can be transmitted even when sores are not visible (asymptomatic shedding).</li>
            <li>Mother to child transmission: A pregnant woman with genital herpes can transmit the virus to her baby during childbirth (neonatal herpes).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risk Factors for Genital Herpes</h2>
        <p>
            Factors that can increase the risk of contracting genital herpes include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Having unprotected sex:  Vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom.</li>
            <li>Having multiple sexual partners.</li>
            <li>Having a sexual partner who has genital herpes.</li>
            <li>Female sex: Women are more susceptible to contracting genital herpes than men.</li>
            <li>Weakened immune system:  A weakened immune system increases the risk of contracting the virus and having more severe outbreaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosing Genital Herpes</h2>
        <p>
            Genital herpes is typically diagnosed through a physical examination and laboratory tests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diagnostic methods include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visual examination: A healthcare provider can often diagnose herpes by visually examining the sores.</li>
            <li>Viral culture: A sample is taken from a sore and tested in a laboratory. This test is most accurate when sores are present.</li>
            <li>PCR test: This test detects the virus's genetic material (DNA) and is very accurate, even if sores are not present.</li>
            <li>Blood tests: These tests can detect antibodies to HSV-1 or HSV-2.  A positive blood test indicates a past infection, but it cannot always determine when someone was infected or if they are currently infectious.  Blood tests are not always reliable for diagnosing a new infection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treating Genital Herpes</h2>
        <p>
            There is no cure for genital herpes, but antiviral medications can help manage the symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of outbreaks, and lower the risk of transmitting the virus to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Treatment options include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Antiviral medications:
                <ul>
                    <li>Acyclovir (Zovirax)</li>
                    <li>Valacyclovir (Valtrex)</li>
                    <li>Famciclovir (Famvir)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These medications can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shorten the duration of outbreaks.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the severity of symptoms.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the frequency of recurrences (suppressive therapy).</li>
                    <li>Reduce the risk of transmission to a partner (suppressive therapy).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Pain relief:
                <ul>
                    <li>Over-the-counter pain relievers: Such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help with pain.</li>
                    <li>Topical creams:  May provide some relief from itching and pain.</li>
                    <li>Sitz baths: Soaking in a warm bath can soothe the sores.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prevention of Genital Herpes</h2>
        <p>
            The most effective way to prevent genital herpes is to avoid sexual contact with someone who has the virus. However, since many people don't know they have herpes, or may be shedding the virus without symptoms, the following measures can help reduce the risk of transmission:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use condoms: Consistent and correct use of latex condoms during sexual activity can reduce the risk of transmission. However, condoms do not provide complete protection, as they do not cover all areas that can be affected by herpes.</li>
            <li>Avoid sexual contact when sores are present: The virus is most easily spread when sores are visible.</li>
            <li>Know your partner's status:  Discuss sexual health and STIs with your partner before engaging in sexual activity.</li>
            <li>Consider suppressive therapy: If one partner has genital herpes, daily antiviral medication can reduce the risk of transmission to the other partner.</li>
            <li>Avoid sharing personal items:  Do not share towels, clothing, or other personal items.</li>
            <li>For pregnant women:  Inform your doctor if you have a history of herpes.  Medication may be given to prevent outbreaks during delivery.  A cesarean section may be recommended if there is an active outbreak at the time of delivery to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to the baby.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prognosis</h2>
        <p>
            Genital herpes is a chronic infection, and there is no cure.  However, it is manageable with antiviral medications.  The frequency and severity of outbreaks tend to decrease over time for most people.  Many people with genital herpes lead normal, healthy lives.
