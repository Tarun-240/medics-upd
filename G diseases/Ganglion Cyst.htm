		<h1>Ganglion Cyst</h1>

        <h2>About Ganglion Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            A ganglion cyst is a noncancerous, fluid-filled lump that usually develops near joints or tendons in the wrists, hands, or ankles. These cysts can vary in size, and while they are often painless, they can sometimes cause discomfort, pain, or limit movement if they press on nerves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ganglion cysts have a smooth, rubbery texture.  The fluid inside is similar to the synovial fluid that lubricates joints and tendons.
        </p>

        <h2>Symptoms of Ganglion Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            The most common symptom of a ganglion cyst is the presence of a visible lump. Other symptoms may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A smooth, rubbery lump: The cyst is usually round or oval.</li>
            <li>Location: Most often found on the back of the wrist, but can also occur on the palm side of the wrist, fingers, or around the ankle and foot.</li>
            <li>Size changes: The size of the cyst may fluctuate; it might get larger with activity and smaller with rest.</li>
            <li>Pain or tenderness: If the cyst presses on a nerve, it can cause pain, tingling, numbness, or muscle weakness.</li>
            <li>Limited movement: The cyst may restrict movement of the affected joint.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes of Ganglion Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            The exact cause of ganglion cysts is not fully understood, but they are thought to arise from a herniation or outpouching of the synovium, the tissue that surrounds joints and tendons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several factors may contribute to their development:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Joint or tendon irritation: Repetitive motion or injury to a joint or tendon may lead to the formation of a cyst.</li>
            <li>Synovial fluid buildup: A buildup of synovial fluid can cause the tissue to bulge out, forming a cyst.</li>
            <li>Connective tissue defect:  A weakness or defect in the connective tissue of the joint or tendon sheath may play a role.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risk Factors for Ganglion Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            Factors that may increase the risk of developing ganglion cysts include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age: Ganglion cysts are most common in people between the ages of 15 and 40.</li>
            <li>Sex: Women are more likely to develop ganglion cysts than men.</li>
            <li>Joint or tendon injury: Previous injuries to a joint or tendon may increase the risk.</li>
            <li>Repetitive activities: Activities that involve repetitive wrist or hand movements may increase the risk.</li>
            <li>Osteoarthritis: People with osteoarthritis in the affected joint have a higher risk.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosing Ganglion Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            Ganglion cysts are usually diagnosed based on their appearance and location. A doctor will typically perform a physical examination. Additional tests may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Physical examination: The doctor will check the lump for tenderness, size, and location.</li>
            <li>Aspiration: A needle and syringe are used to withdraw fluid from the cyst. The fluid is clear and thick. This can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.</li>
            <li>Transillumination: Shining a light through the cyst can help determine if it is filled with fluid.</li>
            <li>X-rays: While ganglion cysts themselves don't show up on X-rays, they can be used to rule out other problems, such as arthritis or bone tumors.</li>
            <li>Ultrasound: This imaging test can help distinguish between a cyst and a solid mass.  It can also confirm if the cyst is connected to a joint or tendon.</li>
            <li>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):  An MRI scan can provide detailed images of the soft tissues and can be used to locate the origin of the cyst and identify any associated tendon or joint abnormalities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treating Ganglion Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            Treatment for ganglion cysts depends on the symptoms. Many ganglion cysts disappear on their own. If the cyst is not causing pain or limiting movement, treatment may not be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Treatment options include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Observation: If the cyst is not causing symptoms, your doctor may recommend simply monitoring it.</li>
            <li>Immobilization:  Wearing a splint or brace can immobilize the joint, which may help shrink the cyst and relieve symptoms.</li>
            <li>Aspiration: The fluid is drained from the cyst using a needle and syringe. This can provide temporary relief, but the cyst may recur.</li>
            <li>Injection: After aspiration, a corticosteroid medication may be injected into the cyst to reduce inflammation and prevent recurrence, though this is not always effective.</li>
            <li>Surgery: If the cyst is very painful, limits movement, or recurs after aspiration, surgical removal (excision) of the cyst may be recommended. This involves removing the cyst and its stalk that connects it to the joint or tendon sheath.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prognosis and Prevention of Ganglion Cysts</h2>
        <p>
            Ganglion cysts are usually benign and do not spread.  The prognosis is generally good.  Many cysts disappear without treatment, and even after treatment, recurrence is possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no specific way to prevent ganglion cysts.
