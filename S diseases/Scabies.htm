         <h1>Scabies</h1>

        <h2>Understanding Scabies</h2>
        <p>
            Scabies is a contagious skin infestation caused by tiny mites called *Sarcoptes scabiei*. These mites burrow into the upper layer of the skin where they live and lay their eggs. The infestation leads to intense itching and a pimple-like skin rash. Scabies can affect people of all ages and socioeconomic levels worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scabies is usually spread by direct, prolonged, skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies. It can also be spread by sharing clothing, bedding, or towels, although this is less common.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            The hallmark symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a characteristic skin rash. Other symptoms may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Intense itching:** This is often worse at night or after a hot shower or bath.</li>
            <li>**Pimple-like rash:** Small, raised bumps or blisters may appear, often in lines.</li>
            <li>**Burrow tracks:** Thin, grayish-white or skin-colored lines on the skin surface where the mites have burrowed. These can be difficult to see.</li>
            <li>**Sores:** These can develop from scratching the itchy rash and may become infected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The rash and itching commonly occur in the following areas, although they can appear anywhere on the body:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Between the fingers and toes</li>
            <li>Wrists</li>
            <li>Elbows</li>
            <li>Armpits</li>
            <li>Around the nipples (especially in women)</li>
            <li>Penis</li>
            <li>Waistline</li>
            <li>Buttocks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In infants and young children, the rash may also appear on the head, face, neck, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet.
        </p>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
            Scabies is usually diagnosed based on the characteristic rash and the history of intense itching, especially if there has been close contact with someone who has scabies. A healthcare provider may confirm the diagnosis by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Skin scraping:** Gently scraping a small area of the affected skin and examining it under a microscope to look for mites, eggs, or fecal matter.</li>
            <li>**Clinical examination:** The appearance and distribution of the rash and the presence of burrows can be highly suggestive of scabies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Scabies is treated with prescription creams or lotions that kill the scabies mites and their eggs. It's crucial to follow the doctor's or product label instructions carefully. Common treatments include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Permethrin cream (5%):** This is often the first-line treatment. It is applied to all skin from the neck down (and sometimes the face and scalp, especially in infants and the elderly) and left on for 8-14 hours before washing off. A second application may be needed after 7-14 days.</li>
            <li>**Lindane lotion (1%):** This is another prescription option but is generally not the first choice due to potential side effects. It is applied thinly to all skin from the neck down and washed off after 8 hours. It should not be used by pregnant or breastfeeding women, young children, or people with seizure disorders.</li>
            <li>**Ivermectin:** This can be given as oral tablets, usually as a single dose followed by another dose 1-2 weeks later. It is often used for crusted scabies or in outbreaks in institutions. It is not typically the first-line topical treatment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In addition to treating the infested person, it's essential to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Treat household members and close contacts:** Anyone who has had close physical contact with the infested person should be treated at the same time, even if they don't have symptoms.</li>
            <li>**Wash clothing, bedding, and towels:** Items used in the 2-3 days before treatment should be washed in hot, soapy water and dried on high heat.</li>
            <li>**Dry-clean or seal unwashable items:** Items that cannot be washed should be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours (some sources recommend 2 weeks) to kill the mites.</li>
            <li>**Vacuum carpets and upholstered furniture:** This can help remove any mites that may have fallen off.</li>
            <li>**Avoid re-infestation:** Continue to practice good hygiene and avoid close contact with untreated individuals.</li>
            <li>**Treat itching:** Itching may continue for a few weeks after successful treatment due to an allergic reaction to dead mites and their waste. Calamine lotion, cool compresses, and oral antihistamines can help relieve itching. A doctor may also prescribe a mild corticosteroid cream if the itching is severe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>
            Preventing scabies involves avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person and not sharing personal items such as clothing, bedding, and towels. Prompt treatment of infected individuals and their close contacts is crucial to control outbreaks.

        <h2>Important Information</h2>
        <p>
            Scabies is highly contagious, so it's important to seek medical treatment if you suspect you have it. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully and ensure that all close contacts are treated at the same time to prevent re-infestation. Itching may persist for a while after treatment, but this does not necessarily mean the treatment has failed. If itching continues for more than 2-4 weeks after treatment, consult your healthcare provider again.
