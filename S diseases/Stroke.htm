         <h1>Stroke</h1>

        <h2>Understanding Stroke</h2>
        <p>
            A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial to minimize brain damage and potential long-term complications.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two main types of stroke:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Ischemic stroke:** This is the most common type, accounting for about 85% of all strokes. It occurs when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or other debris.</li>
            <li>**Hemorrhagic stroke:** This occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures. Hemorrhages can be caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure, aneurysms (weakened blood vessels), arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or other conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A transient ischemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a "mini-stroke," is a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. Symptoms are similar to those of a stroke but usually last less than an hour and don't cause permanent brain damage. However, a TIA is a warning sign that a full stroke may occur in the future and requires medical evaluation.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Signs and Symptoms (Act FAST)</h2>
        <p>
            Recognizing the signs and symptoms of a stroke is critical for getting timely medical help. Use the acronym **FAST** to remember the key warning signs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**F - Face Drooping:** Ask the person to smile. Does one side of their face droop?</li>
            <li>**A - Arm Weakness:** Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?</li>
            <li>**S - Speech Difficulty:** Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Is their speech slurred or strange?</li>
            <li>**T - Time to call emergency services:** If you observe any of these signs, call for immediate medical help. Time is critical!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Other symptoms of stroke can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body.</li>
            <li>Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.</li>
            <li>Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.</li>
            <li>Sudden severe headache with no known cause.</li>
            <li>Sudden confusion, trouble understanding, or difficulty speaking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>
            Many factors can increase the risk of stroke. Some risk factors are modifiable, while others are not:
        </p>
        <h3>Modifiable Risk Factors (can be changed or managed)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
            <li>High cholesterol</li>
            <li>Smoking</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>Heart disease (including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and heart failure)</li>
            <li>Obesity</li>
            <li>Physical inactivity</li>
            <li>Unhealthy diet</li>
            <li>Excessive alcohol consumption</li>
            <li>Drug abuse</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Non-Modifiable Risk Factors (cannot be changed)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Age (risk increases with age, especially after 65)</li>
            <li>Family history of stroke</li>
            <li>Race (stroke is more common in African Americans)</li>
            <li>Sex (slightly more common in men, but more women die from stroke)</li>
            <li>Prior stroke or TIA</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
            Prompt diagnosis is essential for effective stroke treatment. Doctors use several methods to diagnose a stroke and determine its type:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Physical and neurological examination:** Assessing symptoms, reflexes, coordination, vision, speech, and mental alertness.</li>
            <li>**Brain imaging:**
                <ul>
                    <li>**Computed tomography (CT) scan:** Usually the first imaging test done to quickly identify if a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic.</li>
                    <li>**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):** Provides more detailed images of the brain and can detect smaller strokes or brain damage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Blood tests:** To check blood sugar levels, cholesterol, clotting factors, and signs of infection.</li>
            <li>**Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):** To check for heart rhythm problems, such as atrial fibrillation, which can increase stroke risk.</li>
            <li>**Carotid ultrasound:** To examine the carotid arteries in the neck for plaque buildup (carotid stenosis), a risk factor for ischemic stroke.</li>
            <li>**Cerebral angiography:** A procedure where a contrast dye is injected into blood vessels in the brain, and X-rays are taken to visualize blood flow and identify blockages or abnormalities.</li>
            <li>**Echocardiogram:** To look for blood clots in the heart that could travel to the brain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Treatment for stroke depends on the type of stroke and how quickly it is diagnosed:
        </p>
        <h3>Ischemic Stroke Treatment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA):** A clot-busting drug that can dissolve the blood clot and restore blood flow to the brain. It must be given within a specific time window (usually within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset).</li>
            <li>**Mechanical thrombectomy:** A procedure where a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin and guided to the blocked artery in the brain. A device is then used to remove the blood clot. This can be effective for large clots and can be done within a longer time window than tPA in some cases.</li>
            <li>**Supportive care:** Including managing blood pressure, blood sugar, and oxygen levels, and preventing complications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hemorrhagic Stroke Treatment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Controlling bleeding:** Medications may be given to counteract blood thinners. Surgery may be needed to repair a ruptured aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.</li>
            <li>**Reducing pressure in the brain:** Medications to reduce swelling and pressure inside the skull. In some cases, surgery may be needed to relieve pressure.</li>
            <li>**Supportive care:** Including careful monitoring of vital signs and preventing complications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rehabilitation</h3>
        <p>
            Rehabilitation is a crucial part of recovery after a stroke. It helps survivors regain lost function and improve their quality of life. Rehabilitation may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Physical therapy:** To improve motor skills, balance, and coordination.</li>
            <li>**Occupational therapy:** To help with daily living activities such as dressing, eating, and bathing.</li>
            <li>**Speech therapy:** To address problems with speaking, understanding, reading, or writing.</li>
            <li>**Psychological counseling:** To help with emotional and cognitive issues such as depression, anxiety, and memory problems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>
            Preventing stroke involves managing modifiable risk factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Control high blood pressure through lifestyle changes and medication.</li>
            <li>Maintain a healthy cholesterol level through diet and medication if needed.</li>
            <li>Quit smoking.</li>
            <li>Manage diabetes through diet, exercise, and medication.</li>
            <li>Eat a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</li>
            <li>Maintain a healthy weight.</li>
            <li>Engage in regular physical activity.</li>
            <li>Limit alcohol consumption.</li>
            <li>Manage heart conditions as recommended by your doctor.</li>
            <li>Take medications as prescribed, such as blood thinners if you have atrial fibrillation.</li>
        </ul>
