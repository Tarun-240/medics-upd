      <h1>Pubic Lice (Crabs)</h1>

        <h2>Understanding Pubic Lice</h2>
        <p>
            Pubic lice, also commonly known as "crabs" due to their crab-like appearance, are tiny parasitic insects that typically infest the pubic hair in the genital area. However, they can also be found on other coarse body hair such as armpit hair, chest hair, beard, mustache, eyebrows, and eyelashes. Pubic lice feed on human blood and can cause itching and irritation in the infested areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pubic lice are usually spread through close physical contact, most often sexual contact. While less common, they can also be transmitted through shared clothing, bedding, or towels. Pubic lice cannot jump or fly; they crawl from one person to another.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            Symptoms of pubic lice can take up to a few weeks to appear after infestation. The most common symptoms include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Intense itching:** This is the most common symptom and is often worse at night when the lice are more active. The itching is an allergic reaction to the lice's saliva.</li>
            <li>**Visible lice:** Adult pubic lice are small (about the size of a pinhead), grayish-white to brownish in color, and can be seen moving in the hair. They may appear darker after feeding on blood.</li>
            <li>**Nits (lice eggs):** These are tiny, yellowish-white or pearly dots firmly attached to the base of the hair shafts near the skin. They are harder to remove than dandruff. Empty, hatched nits may also be visible.</li>
            <li>**Small red or blue spots on the skin:** These are bite marks from the lice.</li>
            <li>**Dark red or brown spots in underwear:** This can be louse droppings ("lice poo").</li>
            <li>**Irritated or inflamed skin:** Due to scratching.</li>
            <li>**Pale bluish spots on the thighs or lower abdomen:** These may occur from repeated bites.</li>
            <li>**Crusty or sticky eyelashes:** If the eyelashes are infested.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
            Pubic lice infestation is usually diagnosed by visual examination of the affected areas. A healthcare provider may use a magnifying lens to help see the lice or nits. If lice or nits are found, treatment is recommended.
        </p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Pubic lice can be effectively treated with over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medications. It's important to follow the instructions on the product label carefully. Common treatments include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Over-the-counter (OTC) medications:** Lotions, creams, or shampoos containing 1% permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide are usually the first-line treatment. These are applied to the affected hair and skin according to the product instructions and then washed off after the recommended time. Treatment may need to be repeated in 7-10 days to kill any newly hatched lice.</li>
            <li>**Prescription medications:** If OTC treatments are not effective, a doctor may prescribe stronger medications such as malathion lotion, ivermectin lotion or oral ivermectin, or lindane shampoo (though lindane is not commonly used due to potential side effects).</li>
            <li>**Treatment for eyelashes and eyebrows:** If lice are found on the eyelashes or eyebrows, petroleum jelly can be carefully applied twice a day for several weeks to suffocate the lice and nits. In some cases, a doctor may prescribe a topical ophthalmic ointment. Live lice and nits can also be manually removed with fine forceps or fingernails.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In addition to treating the infested person, it's crucial to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Wash clothing, bedding, and towels:** Items used in the 2-3 days before treatment should be washed in hot, soapy water (at least 130°F/54°C) and dried on high heat for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>**Dry-clean or seal unwashable items:** If items cannot be washed, they should be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for two weeks to kill any lice and nits.</li>
            <li>**Avoid sexual contact:** Until both the infested person and their sexual partners have been fully treated.</li>
            <li>**Inform sexual partners:** All sexual partners from the past month should be notified and treated to prevent re-infestation.</li>
            <li>**Avoid sharing personal items:** Such as clothing, towels, and bedding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>
            The best way to prevent pubic lice is to avoid close physical contact, especially sexual contact, with someone who has pubic lice. Other preventive measures include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Avoiding sharing personal items:** Do not share clothing, towels, bedding, or razors with others.</li>
            <li>**Practicing good hygiene:** While not a direct prevention method for pubic lice themselves, maintaining cleanliness can help prevent secondary infections from scratching.</li>
            <li>**Getting tested for other STIs:** Pubic lice infestation can sometimes occur with other sexually transmitted infections, so getting tested is advisable.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="important-information-box">
        <h2>Important Information</h2>
        <p>
            Pubic lice are treatable and do not usually cause serious health problems. However, the itching can be very uncomfortable and lead to skin irritation or secondary infections from scratching. If you suspect you have pubic lice, it's important to seek treatment promptly and inform your sexual partners to prevent further spread. If over-the-counter treatments are not effective, consult a doctor for prescription options.
