         <h1>Polio (Poliomyelitis)</h1>

        <h2>Understanding Polio</h2>
        <p>
            Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a contagious viral illness that can lead to nerve injury (paralysis), difficulty breathing, and sometimes death. The poliovirus typically enters the body through the mouth, often from contaminated water or food, and multiplies in the intestine. From there, it can invade the nervous system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks to widespread vaccination efforts, polio has been largely eradicated globally. However, it remains a threat in a few countries, and there is no cure once paralysis occurs, making prevention through vaccination crucial.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            Most people infected with poliovirus won't have any visible symptoms. About 25% of infected people will have flu-like symptoms that usually last 2 to 5 days and then go away on their own. These mild symptoms can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sore throat</li>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Tiredness</li>
            <li>Nausea</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>Stomach pain</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In a smaller proportion of cases (less than 1%), the poliovirus can attack the nervous system, leading to more severe symptoms:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Stiffness in the neck and back**</li>
            <li>**Muscle weakness:** Can affect one or more limbs and may be asymmetrical (affecting one side more than the other).</li>
            <li>**Loss of reflexes**</li>
            <li>**Severe muscle aches or spasms**</li>
            <li>**Paralysis:** Can be temporary or permanent and most often affects the legs. In severe cases, it can affect the muscles used for breathing, leading to life-threatening complications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Post-Polio Syndrome</h2>
        <p>
            Even after recovering from the initial paralytic polio, some individuals may develop post-polio syndrome (PPS) decades later (typically 15 to 40 years after the initial illness). PPS is a condition characterized by a new onset of muscle weakness, fatigue, and pain in muscles and joints. Other symptoms can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Muscle atrophy (loss of muscle mass)</li>
            <li>Breathing or swallowing problems</li>
            <li>Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnoea</li>
            <li>Decreased tolerance to cold temperatures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The exact cause of PPS is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the damage to motor neurons during the initial polio illness.
        </p>

        <h2>Transmission of Polio</h2>
        <p>
            The poliovirus is highly contagious and spreads through:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Direct person-to-person contact:** Through small droplets sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes (though this is less common).</li>
            <li>**Contact with infected faeces:** The virus lives in the faeces of an infected person and can contaminate food and water if hygiene is poor. This is the most common route of transmission.</li>
            <li>**Contaminated water and food:** Especially in areas with poor sanitation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            People can be contagious even if they don't have symptoms. The virus can live in an infected person's faeces for several weeks.
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention: Vaccination is Key</h2>
        <p>
            Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent polio. There are two types of polio vaccines used worldwide:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV):** Given as an injection. It is very safe and effective in preventing paralytic polio.</li>
            <li>**Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV):** Given as drops in the mouth. OPV has been instrumental in global polio eradication efforts as it can also help to stop the spread of the virus in communities. However, in very rare cases, the weakened virus in OPV can mutate and cause vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), which can also cause paralysis. For this reason, many countries that have eliminated wild poliovirus are now using IPV exclusively or in combination with OPV.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The World Health Organization (WHO) and other global health organizations continue to work towards the complete eradication of polio worldwide through vaccination campaigns.
        </p>

        <h2>Treatment of Polio</h2>
        <p>
            There is no cure for polio once paralysis has occurred. Treatment focuses on supportive care to manage symptoms and prevent complications. This may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Bed rest**</li>
            <li>**Pain relievers**</li>
            <li>**Portable ventilators:** To assist with breathing if respiratory muscles are affected.</li>
            <li>**Physical therapy:** To help maintain muscle strength and function as much as possible.</li>
            <li>**Occupational therapy:** To help with daily living activities.</li>
            <li>**Braces and other assistive devices:** To support weakened limbs and improve mobility.</li>
            <li>**Surgery:** In some cases, surgery may be needed to address deformities caused by paralysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For individuals with post-polio syndrome, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life through strategies like exercise programs tailored to avoid overfatigue, pain management, and assistive devices.

        <h2>Important Information</h2>
        <p>
            Polio is a preventable disease through vaccination. Ensure that you and your children are fully vaccinated against polio according to the recommended schedule. If you are traveling to areas where polio is still circulating, it is essential to be up-to-date on your vaccinations.
