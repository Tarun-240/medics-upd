 <h1>Tuberculosis (TB)</h1>

        <h2>Understanding Tuberculosis</h2>
        <p>
            Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infection caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, kidneys, or spine. TB is spread through the air when people with active TB disease in their lungs cough, sneeze, speak, or sing, and others inhale the bacteria.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two TB-related conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Latent TB infection (LTBI):** The bacteria live in the body but don't cause illness. People with LTBI don't feel sick, don't have symptoms, and can't spread TB to others. However, LTBI can progress to TB disease.</li>
            <li>**TB disease (active TB):** The bacteria are active and multiply, causing illness. People with TB disease are sick and can spread the bacteria to others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Without proper treatment, TB disease can be serious and even fatal.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Signs and Symptoms of TB Disease</h2>
        <p>
            The symptoms of TB disease depend on which part of the body is affected. TB in the lungs (pulmonary TB) is the most common form and can cause:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**A persistent cough lasting three or more weeks.**</li>
            <li>**Pain in the chest.**</li>
            <li>**Coughing up blood or sputum (phlegm).**</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Other symptoms of TB disease may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unintentional weight loss.</li>
            <li>Fatigue.</li>
            <li>Fever.</li>
            <li>Night sweats.</li>
            <li>Loss of appetite.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB) vary depending on the affected area. For example, TB of the spine may cause back pain, while TB of the lymph nodes may cause swelling.
        </p>

        <h2>Risk Factors for TB Disease</h2>
        <p>
            People at higher risk of developing TB disease include those who:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have been in close contact with someone who has TB disease.</li>
            <li>Have HIV infection or other conditions that weaken the immune system.</li>
            <li>Were born in or have traveled to countries where TB is common (e.g., parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America).</li>
            <li>Live or work in congregate settings where TB is more common (e.g., correctional facilities, nursing homes, homeless shelters).</li>
            <li>Are infants and young children.</li>
            <li>Have substance use disorders.</li>
            <li>Have certain medical conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, or organ transplants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
            Several tests are used to diagnose TB infection and TB disease:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Tuberculin skin test (TST) or Mantoux test:** A small amount of tuberculin is injected under the skin of the forearm. A reaction (a raised, hard area) measured 48 to 72 hours later indicates a likely TB infection (latent or active).</li>
            <li>**TB blood tests (interferon-gamma release assays - IGRAs):** These tests measure how the immune system reacts to TB bacteria in a blood sample. Examples include the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) and the T-SPOT.TB test. IGRAs are often preferred for people who have received the BCG vaccine or who may have difficulty returning for a TST reading.</li>
            <li>**Chest X-ray:** If a TST or IGRA is positive, a chest X-ray is usually done to look for signs of TB disease in the lungs.</li>
            <li>**Sputum tests:** If the chest X-ray suggests TB disease, sputum samples are collected and examined under a microscope for TB bacteria. Cultures are also done to grow the bacteria and identify the specific strain and its drug sensitivity.</li>
            <li>**Other tests:** Depending on the suspected site of TB disease, other tests such as biopsies, lumbar puncture, or imaging scans (CT scan, MRI) may be necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            TB is treatable with antibiotics. The treatment for latent TB infection is different from the treatment for TB disease.
        </p>
        <h3>Treatment for Latent TB Infection (LTBI)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Usually involves taking one antibiotic, such as isoniazid (INH), rifapentine, or rifampin, for a period of 3 to 9 months. The specific regimen depends on the individual's risk factors and other medical conditions. Treatment of LTBI helps prevent the development of TB disease.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Treatment for TB Disease (Active TB)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Involves taking a combination of several antibiotics (usually four drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for an initial phase of about two months, followed by a continuation phase of two drugs (usually isoniazid and rifampin) for an additional 4 to 7 months. The total duration of treatment is typically 6 to 9 months.</li>
            <li>It is crucial to take all TB medications exactly as prescribed and for the entire duration of treatment to kill all the bacteria and prevent drug resistance.</li>
            <li>Directly observed therapy (DOT) may be recommended, where a healthcare worker watches the patient swallow each dose of medication to ensure adherence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            People with TB disease are usually contagious and need to take precautions to prevent spreading the bacteria to others, such as covering their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, not visiting other people, and staying home from work or school during the initial infectious period.
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>
            Preventing the spread of TB involves several strategies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Identifying and treating people with TB disease:** This is the most important way to stop the spread of TB.</li>
            <li>**Testing and treating people with latent TB infection:** This prevents them from developing TB disease.</li>
            <li>**Vaccination with BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin):** The BCG vaccine is used in many countries with a high prevalence of TB to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, it is not widely used in the United States because of its variable effectiveness against pulmonary TB in adults and its interference with the TST.</li>
            <li>**Infection control measures:** In healthcare settings and congregate settings, measures are taken to prevent the spread of TB, such as proper ventilation, isolation of infectious patients, and the use of personal protective equipment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important Information</h2>
        <p>
            TB is a serious but treatable disease. If you have symptoms of TB or have been in contact with someone who has TB, it's important to get tested. Completing the full course of treatment is essential to cure the infection and prevent its spread.
