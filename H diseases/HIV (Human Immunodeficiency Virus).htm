         <h1>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)</h1>

        <h2>Understanding HIV</h2>
        <p>
            Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help the body fight off infections. If left untreated, HIV can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition where the immune system is severely damaged, making the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and certain cancers.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there is currently no cure for HIV, effective medical treatments can control the virus and help people with HIV live long and healthy lives, as well as prevent transmission to others.
        </p>

        <h2>Symptoms of HIV</h2>
        <p>
            Symptoms of HIV can vary depending on the stage of infection.
        </p>
        <h3>Acute HIV Infection (within 2-4 weeks after infection):</h3>
        <p>
            Many people develop flu-like symptoms, often described as the "worst flu ever." These symptoms can last for a few days to several weeks and may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
            <li>Sore throat</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>Muscle aches</li>
            <li>Rash</li>
            <li>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's important to note that not everyone will experience these symptoms, and they can be easily mistaken for other viral illnesses.
        </p>
        <h3>Clinical Latency (Chronic HIV):</h3>
        <p>
            After the initial infection, the virus becomes less active (latent), although it is still present in the body. Many people in this stage may not have any symptoms or only mild ones. Without treatment, this stage can last for many years before the viral load increases and the CD4 cell count drops, leading to AIDS.
        </p>
        <h3>AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome):</h3>
        <p>
            AIDS is the most severe stage of HIV infection. It occurs when the immune system is severely damaged (CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/mm³) and the body becomes susceptible to opportunistic infections (infections that rarely cause illness in people with healthy immune systems) and certain cancers. Symptoms of AIDS can vary widely depending on the specific opportunistic infections present and may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rapid weight loss</li>
            <li>Extreme fatigue</li>
            <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
            <li>Prolonged diarrhea</li>
            <li>Pneumonia</li>
            <li>Skin rashes or lesions</li>
            <li>Memory loss, confusion, or neurological disorders</li>
            <li>Opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), tuberculosis (TB), and candidiasis (thrush)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transmission of HIV</h2>
        <p>
            HIV is transmitted through certain body fluids from an infected person to an uninfected person. The most common ways HIV is transmitted include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Having anal or vaginal sex with an HIV-positive person without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent HIV.</li>
            <li>Sharing needles or syringes for drug injection with someone who has HIV.</li>
            <li>From mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding (vertical transmission). However, this risk can be significantly reduced with proper medical care and treatment.</li>
            <li>Less commonly, through blood transfusions or organ transplants (in countries where blood and organ screening is not rigorous).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            HIV is **not** spread through casual contact such as shaking hands, hugging, sharing toilets or eating utensils, or being bitten by mosquitoes or other insects.
        </p>

        <h2>Diagnosis of HIV</h2>
        <p>
            HIV is diagnosed through blood or saliva tests that look for the presence of HIV antibodies, antigens (parts of the virus), or the virus itself. Common tests include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Antibody tests:** Detect antibodies that the body produces to fight HIV. These are the most common type of HIV test.</li>
            <li>**Antigen/antibody tests:** Look for both HIV antibodies and antigens. These tests can detect HIV earlier than antibody tests alone.</li>
            <li>**Nucleic acid tests (NATs):** Look for the actual virus in the blood. These tests are usually used for people with high viral loads or to confirm a positive antibody or antigen/antibody test.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's important to get tested if you think you may have been exposed to HIV. Early diagnosis allows for prompt treatment and helps prevent transmission to others.
        </p>

        <h2>Treatment of HIV</h2>
        <p>
            The main treatment for HIV is **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**. ART involves taking a combination of medications that work to slow the progression of HIV by reducing the amount of the virus in the body (viral load). Key benefits of ART include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preventing HIV from advancing to AIDS.</li>
            <li>Allowing the immune system to recover and fight off opportunistic infections.</li>
            <li>Reducing the risk of transmitting HIV to others (when the viral load is undetectable).</li>
            <li>Improving the overall health and quality of life for people with HIV.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            ART is highly effective, and with consistent adherence to medication regimens, people with HIV can live long and healthy lives. Regular medical care, monitoring of viral load and CD4 cell count, and management of any other health conditions are also crucial.
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention of HIV</h2>
        <p>
            Several effective strategies can prevent the transmission of HIV:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Using condoms correctly and consistently** during sexual activity.</li>
            <li>**Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP):** Taking daily medication by HIV-negative individuals at risk of HIV to prevent infection.</li>
            <li>**Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP):** Taking antiretroviral medications after a potential exposure to HIV to prevent infection. PEP must be started within 72 hours of exposure.</li>
            <li>**Not sharing needles or syringes.**</li>
            <li>**Getting tested for HIV** and encouraging partners to get tested.</li>
            <li>**Treatment as Prevention (TasP):** People with HIV who take ART and achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load cannot transmit HIV to their sexual partners (Undetectable = Untransmittable, or U=U).</li>
            <li>For pregnant individuals with HIV, taking ART can significantly reduce the risk of transmission to their baby.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Education, awareness, and access to prevention and treatment services are essential in the fight against HIV.
